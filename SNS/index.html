    <h2>ABOUT THIS GAME</h2>

    <p>Saiko No Sutoka is a Horror Survival Game where you as a Protagonist must escape and avoid the crazy yandere
      girl who wants you dead.<br>The Antagonist, Saiko Chan is a psycho Serial Killer. She’s a very unique Yandere
      type. She loves to play with you before she has a chance to kill you.<br>The game focuses more on The
      Antagonist, Saiko Chan. Her playful AI behaviour towards her Senpai which is you as The Player.</p>

    <p>There are two states of saiko AI as she suffers from DID Which makes surviving from saiko unique compared to
      other horror survival games:</p>

    <p>Yandere State<br>In this state, Saiko Chan is not directly hostile towards The Player but she will not let The
      Player escape and atempt to stop Player progression by slowing Player down by various means.</p>

    <p>Yangire State<br>In this state, Saiko Chan is very hostile, she will try any way to kill The Player such as she
      will hide and atempt to amsbush The Player before returning back to Yandere State once she has done enough
      damage.</p>

    <p>The main objective of the game:<br>You are trapped in the school abducted by the Saiko Chan. This, the goal is
      to escape from the school by collecting numbers that would unlock the safe that contains the exit door key.</p>

    <p>The game introduces 3 modes in The Steam early launch with her own visual looks.</p>

    <p>1. Yandere Mode where Saiko Chan is shown as sane version of prior version of her before snap snapped
      (Tutorial/Story mode)<br>2. Normal and Hard Mode is what the normal Saiko game play where we need to
      escape.<br>3. Yangire Mode; this is the hardest mode and only for those that wants a challenge. (Very difficult
      mode)</p>

    <p>Let’s play our game now!</p>

    <p>#SaikoNoSutoka #ホラゲー #ヤンデレ</p>

    <p>The game is in alpha 2.1 and will going to get alot more content in the future with newer updates as i plan to
      make this game with fully fleshed out AI which is rarely seen in todays game.</p>
